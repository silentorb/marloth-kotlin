# Marloth Scenery

At this point the package name is a misnomer.  This package used to contain shared scenery data structures but those have all been moved.  Now it only contains ids.

As a rule of thumb, it uses enums for sets of narrow, specialized ids and grouped string fields for large enums that could easily be externally extended.
