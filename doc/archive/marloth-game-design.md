### Favorite RPG Games

* Dark Souls
* Tales of Maj'Eyal
* The Binding of Isaac
* Grim Dawn
* Neverwinter Nights

### Character Growth

My single favorite part of games is the screen where you select new abilities when you level up.  It's the part of the game I've always felt I don't see enough of in an RPG.  I've always wanted to play an RPG that was designed to make you regularly visiting that screen without increasing grind.

### Information Gathering

To have strategy, the player must have some idea of what lies ahead.

### Rules for Items, Abilities, and Modifiers

* Order of ability acquisition should not matter (should be commutative)
* When applying modifiers, all operations should be aggregated and batched
  * Example: All addition should be applied first and then all multiplication second, and each multiplier should be added together, leading to a single multiplication operation

### Character Growth

Right now I'm leaning toward a character system with:

* Single and dual character classes
* No leveling
* Item system with no inventory and four general equipment slots
* Unlimited ability system
* Some items and abilities are constrained to certain classes
* Your class influences the types of items you find
  * Players should come across some items for other classes so that:
    * They feel some tension to add another class (if they don't already have a second)
    * It feels a little more realistic to find a mix
  * Players should not come across too many items from other classes:
    * To minimize junk items
    * To prevent imbalanced streaks where the player can't use anything they come across
* Possibly added weight is given to a player's first class
  * Such as some abilities that are only available if a certain class is your primary class
