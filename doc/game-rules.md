## Character Resources

### Overview

#### List

Each character has the following resources:
* Health / Injury
* Food / Starvation
* Sanity / Madness
* Energy / Exhaustion

Each resource waxes / wanes over time

#### Limits

* If a character's Injury or Starvation reach 100% that character dies
* If a character's Energy reaches 100% that character is rendered unconscious until woken

* If a character's Madness reaches 100% that character becomes an out of control monster
  * This state could be called "Beyond Sane"

* If either Injury, Starvation or Madness reach 100% for a player, the game is over
  * Multiplayer may still have respawning
    * Not sure how respawning would work for 100% Madness

#### Perspective

* When a player's sanity is greater than or equal to 50%, resources are described in positive terms

* When a player's sanity is below 50%, resources are described in negative terms.

### Details

#### Injury

* Injuries are mostly gained through combat
* Injuries can also be gained through fall damage
  * Possibly also by getting crushed between heavy collision objects?
* Injuries

#### Starvation

#### Madness

* As the player's madness increases, worse monsters and calamities are unleashed upon the denizens of the world
* The effects are a metaphor for and reflection of the player character's own wickedness
* Spiritually edifying activities reduce madness

#### Exhaustion

* May have a dream dimension that the player can interact with while sleeping
