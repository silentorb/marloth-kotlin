# More Marloth Game Design

## Goals and Ideas

* Personal and macroâ€”little interest in everything in-between
  * For example, little interest in equipment, which is neither intrinsic to the character nor global in its influence
* Show a small immediate world with an implied vast world beyond it
* Define different domains of life and integrate them via currencies
* Influence the macro world through interactions with the micro world
* In turn the micro world is influenced by the macro world
* The macro world takes its turn every time you sleep
* Have the world be like a website where player moves around in 3D like navigating between web pages and interacts with different world objects like they were web forms
* The 3D world would be the user's workshop that they would have limited support for personalization and optimization

## Challenges

* The micro and the macro will need to be integrated or I shouldn't have both
  * How do I integrate the micro and macro?
* How do I provide macro data to the player?
  * Normally it would be displayed in a GUI using stats, graphs, and tables
* Would moving around a 3D world to perform tasks that would more quickly be performed by an abstract GUI feel tedious?
* How do I imply the vast world beyond?
