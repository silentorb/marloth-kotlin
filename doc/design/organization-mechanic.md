# Organization as a Game Mechanic

* One of my favorite activities is turning chaos into order
  * Fixing broken systems
* There's a tension in this process that resonates with spiritual themes
  * Where you are trying to make the world a better place
  * The now and not yet, where you are trying to make a system more ideal but need to be content with a compromise
    * It requires a balance of caring and acceptance
* Such a mechanism makes antagonists more poignant
  * Normally in games of a similar type, particular first person shooters, antagonists are passive
    * They wait in one place until the player reaches a certain proximity and then they attack him
    * Not only do they wait until the player is nearby to do anything menacing, but they only menace the player
  * But if the game revolves around order vs. chaos, then the forces are less directly engaging each other, but instead engaging the world in general
  * Independent of the player's location, the antagonists are indirectly hurting him by ruining the world he cares about
  * It's like repeatedly building a tower of blocks only to have the toddler come along and knock it over
