# Marloth Game Design Challenges

## Pure Design Issues

1. Minimal combat conflicts with a combat-centric genre
2. It is hard to procedurally generate rich, congruent worlds
3. A mind bending genre conflicts with longevity
4. Simulation vs goal-driven gameplay
5. Holistic world building conflicts with a surreal world

Design Issues Due to Relatively Limited Resources

1. A one person team
2. Custom game engine

## Solutions

### Have less enemies

* Go for more isolation
* Have even less roaming enemies
  * Shift most enemies to being territorial

### Leverage Surrealism

* Don't be surreal for surreal's sake
  * Rely on emergent surrealism
  * Surrealism should be used as a tool to resolve other issues

### At this point simulation trumps goal-driven gameplay
