# Marloth Map Design Guidelines

## Glossary

* Zone - a distinct section of a map
  * Zones form a conceptual node graph

## Issues

### Anticipation

* When moving along a path, there should be a continuity between where the player is and where the player will be a little ways down the road
* Avoid right angle turns in primary paths
  * Right angle turns should be integrated into larger zones
    * In other words, if a hallway needs to make a right angle turn, place an entire room where the turn would be
* Paths can make right angle turns if it is meant to be jarring and draws attention to the fact that it is jarring (such as with a sign)

#### Notes

* This is the opposite and micro version of [Misdirection](Misdirection)

### Branching

* Branches should look different
  * Each choice within a fork should have a distinct personality, such as, "should I go to the murky swamp or the fiery dungeon?"
* Branches should function differently
  * Avoid forks where whether you go left or right, you'll end up in the same place in the same manner
    * This happens most often in games when they use symmetrical forks

### Cozy

* Minimize large open zones
* Minimize zones without some degree of closure
* Minimize zones that are completely enclosed (claustrophobic)
* Use windows liberally
  * The theme of Marloth design is a small inner world with clear visibility to a vast outer world
  * Underground zones could break this rule for occasional claustrophobia, but even then underground areas can also use doors and windows to create that sense of connection to something larger

### Dense

* Minimize filler
* Cram things as close together as possible without breaking the other rules

## Misdirection

#### Rules

* Players should rarely be able to get to a destination by going in a straight line
* Paths and the arrangement of nodes should be dizzying

#### Notes

* This is the opposite and macro version of [Anticipation](Anticipation)

### Significance

#### Summary

Every zone should have a distinct personality and function

#### Rules

* Avoid long zones that only exist to connect other zones
  * Connect meaningful zones with other meaningful zones
  * Purely generic connections should be short

### Simple travel methods

Marloth doesn't have

* Jumping (short of possibly eventually special abilities)
* Climbing
* Moving platforms

The primary form of vertical travel is stairs and slopes

Players can drop down, though longer drops will be subject to fall damage

Marloth will probably eventually have portals

### Spatially Holistic

* Aesthetically Pleasing from every major position and angle

### Transitions

* Avoid abrupt contrasts between adjacent zones
* Join disparate zones with smaller intermediate zones

### Vertical
