# Core Game

10% of a game is it's core gameplay.  The other 90% is garnishes built on top of that foundation.

The core gameplay is a solution that should solve the game's core problems.  While it can be tempting, don't try to solve core game problems with secondary features.  Inversely, core gameplay should not solve secondary problems.  Core problems should be solved with core gameplay and secondary problems should be solved with secondary features.

A good example of this division is Magic the Gathering.  While cards that alter the rules tend to steal the show, Magic has a complete layer of rules independent of clauses printed on cards.  The game is actually playable with decks consisting of nothing but lands and vanilla creatures.  The core rules define the foundation of the game.  Every rule can be overridden by cards, but those cards are ephemeral.  The core rules are far more constant.
