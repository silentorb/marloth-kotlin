# Genre Defining Game Design Questions

Each Genre is a recipe.  Below is a list of questions that helps gather the ingredients that differentiate one genre from another, and empower designers to more easily devise new genres.

## What is the primary activity?

Any good game has a primary activity that acts as the foundation of the gameplay.  A good game can have any number of secondary activities.  The primary activity is the fallback.  At any point in the game where there isn't a secondary activity, the game falls back to the player performing the primary activity.  Ideally the secondary activities should assist and affect the primary activity.

Some examples of common primary activities are

* Running around shooting things
* Jumping across platforms
* Managing an organization
* Solving puzzles
* Gathering resources

## What does the game reward?

A game is a system of rewards.  Each game rewards particular attributes and activities of a player.  Games can reward players for:

* Critical thinking
* Quick reflexes
* Being lucky
* Management
* Particular knowledge
* Etc.

Note that it is far less important what the reward is.  Most rewards in games are illusion, while the challenge is real.

## What is the user interface?

The user interface is the system that connects the player to the game world.  UI is the biggest bottleneck in games.  You could have the most elaborate game simulation in the world but it's value would be restricted by how the player can perceive and interact with that simulation.

A rule of thumb which adds weight to the importance of UI is if a game has a mechanic, that mechanic should be depicted.

Game UIs roughly fall into one of 6 categories

* Text-based
* Abstract GUI (consisting mostly of menus and reports)
* Controlling a single entity from a 2D perspective
* Controlling a single entity from a 3D first-person perspective
* Controlling a single entity from a 3D third-person perspective
* Controlling many entities from a Godlike perspective

## What is the play cycle [continuity]?

Gameplay can be divided into game cycles.  Some of those cycles have sub-cycles.  Some games are designed to be played through many times.  Some games are designed to only be played through once.  Some games can be divided into many layers of cycles, such as:

* Skirmishes
* Sessions
* Playthroughs

* Not actually a cycle but the entire time a player ever spends playing the game
