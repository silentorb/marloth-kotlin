# Marloth Game Design Guidelines

## Style and Substance

### Rules

* Avoid elaborate artistic details that neither alter nor communicate significant game state

## Surrealism

### Rules

* For every design problem, explore whether it can be resolved by surrealism
* Don't be surreal for surreal's sake
  * Rely on emergent, need-driven surrealism
* Do not put significant investment in making world elements precisely identifiable
  * A key part of surrealism is having associations that are not obvious and instead are subconsciously identified
  * A home simply needs to feel "homelike"
    * Example: The bonfire in the Depths in Dark Souls feels homelike and it's just a boxy room
* The world does not need to be fully congruent
  * It should have enough congruency so as to not break gameplay or make the gameplay feel clunky
* Minimize attempts at translating surreal elements from other types of media
  * Focus on home-grown surrealism
  * This means the Marloth game and the books may be very different in terms of world composition
    * But this shouldn't conflict with them having a similar tone and atmosphere

## Systems

### Rules

* Avoid scripted events
* Minimize one-off mechanics
* Rely on general systems to supply game logic
* When a system is providing player challenge, it requires a minimal level of complexity to be meaningful
