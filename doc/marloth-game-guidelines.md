# Marloth Game Design Guidelines

## Anticipation

### Rules

* As much as possible, the player should have carrots driving them forward
  * This rule would be stronger for other game genres
    * Since this game is focusing heavily on simulation with a splash of sandbox, It's not practical to require there always to be a player carrot

## Choices

### Rules

* Choices should be informed
  * Players do not need to be comprehensively informed but enough so that they can weigh their options
* When faced with choices, players should be be able to anticipate some future situations
  * This can either be accomplished by:
    * Explicitly presenting the player with future circumstances
    * Game mechanics that imply future circumstances
  * Player informing should have a decay rate where much information is provided for the now and less information is provided for the future
* Player choices should matter
  * In other words, player choices should have significant impact on game state
* Choices should have clear causality
* Choice factors should be compositional
  * The outcome of any choice in the game should be affected by composable circumstances
* Each Choice should have the potential for each of its options to be more efficient than any other option depending on circumstances

## Style and Substance

### Rules

* Avoid elaborate artistic details that neither alter nor communicate significant game state

## Surrealism

### Rules

* For every design problem, explore whether it can be resolved by surrealism
* Don't be surreal for surreal's sake
  * Rely on emergent, need-driven surrealism
* Do not put significant investment in making game elements precisely identifiable
  * A key part of surrealism is having associations that are not obvious and instead are subconsciously identified
  * A home simply needs to feel "homelike"
    * Example: The bonfire in the Depths in Dark Souls feels homelike and it's just a boxy room
* The world does not need to be fully congruent
  * It should have enough congruency so as to not break gameplay or make the gameplay feel clunky
* Minimize attempts at translating surreal elements from other types of media
  * Focus on home-grown surrealism
  * That means the Marloth game and the books may be very different in terms of world composition
    * But that shouldn't conflict with them having a similar tone and atmosphere

## Systems

### Rules

* Avoid scripted events
* Minimize one-off mechanics
* Rely on general systems to supply game logic
* When a system is providing player challenge, it requires a minimal level of complexity to be meaningful
