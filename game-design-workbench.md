## Honing the game

### Genre

If I had to pick a single genre for Marloth, I'd have to say it would be RPG, and I'm kind of surprised by that.  Half of my inspirations have been non-RPGs, but those inspirations have primarily influenced setting, visual-style, and basic 3d mechanics.  In terms of gameplay, my primary influences have all been RPGs.  Part of the reason I have tried to avoid RPGs is because how they sometimes tend to be introverted when the focus on single character growth, but I love single character growth.  It's one of my favorite parts about games.  Part of why I love it so much is because it's personal.  I am far more interested in the intrinsic abilities of a character than their equipment, which is different from a lot of players.

I'd also love to have as much strategy and simulation in this game as possible, but at the end of the day, RPGs have been far more staples than those other genres.  I need to think more in terms of staples.  I don't want to create a novelty game that is more creative than practical.
